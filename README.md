## About The Website

I started this repository my freshmen year of college at Pitt.  I wanted to try using programming languages and frameworks that I was unfamiliar with like html, javascript, css, the react framework, basically learning web development while making a website to showcase projects.

It may not be updated very often as school keeps me busy, but we will see in the future how much I improve the layout and information.
